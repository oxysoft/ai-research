# Pattern Recognition

Pattern Recognition system for 1D stimuli.


## Impulse

- Carries a small package of data
- Trace of the path

## Neuron

- Has inbound connections
- Has outbound connections
- Encodes a reversible information of arbitrary size
- Modifies the impulse
- Can stay activated (has memory)

## Link

- 

## Neuron Collapse

- Upon running the same pattern of activation several times, the pattern can collapse into a new neuron


# Music Implementation

<!-- ## Sound Neuron -->
<!-- ## SNote Neuron -->

## Note Neuron

- Absolute
- Offset
